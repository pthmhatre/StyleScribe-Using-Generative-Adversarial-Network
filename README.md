# StyleScribe-Using-Generative-Adversarial-Network
<div align="justify">
StyleScribe is a sophisticated text-to-image generation project that leverages state-of-the-art techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The primary objective of this project is to generate high-quality images of fashion products based on textual descriptions. By bridging the semantic gap between text and visual content, StyleScribe offers an innovative solution for the fashion industry, enabling the creation of visual content from descriptive text inputs.

Key Features<br>
<div align="justify">
Text-to-Image Generation: StyleScribe uses advanced GAN models to convert textual descriptions into realistic images of fashion products.<br>
Large Dataset: The project utilizes a meticulously curated dataset of 44,000 fashion product images and their corresponding descriptions to train the model.<br>
NLP Integration: Extensive preprocessing of textual data ensures semantic coherence and relevance, enhancing the quality of generated images.<br>
Custom GAN Architecture: A tailored GAN model, comprising a generator and discriminator, is designed to produce high-fidelity fashion images.<br>
Scalable Infrastructure: The project is  hosted on Google Cloud RDP and uses Flask for the web interface and Firebase for real-time database management.<br>
